*December 6, 2023 - This version has been archived as it no longer suited my needs.*

Found yourself in quick need to extract text from an image in Discord? Meet Jet, a discord bot that aims to extract text from any image attachment you feed it!

Powered by [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR)

## Usage

All commands are prepended with the `$` symbol.

- `$text` - Extracts text from an image while providing accuracy on how well the extraction performed.

In order to extract text correct, you **must** have an image attachment alongside the `$text` command. Otherwise, Jet will get angry and throw an error back at you!
