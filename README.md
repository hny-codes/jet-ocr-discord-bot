Found yourself in quick need to extract text from an image in Discord? Meet Jet, a discord bot that aims to extract text from any image attachment you feed it!

Powered by [Python-tesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)

## Usage

All commands are prepended with the `$` symbol.

- `$text` - Extracts text from an image while providing accuracy on how well the extraction performed.

In order to extract text correct, you **must** have an image attachment alongside the `$text` command. Otherwise, Jet will get angry and throw an error back at you!
